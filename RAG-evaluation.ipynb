The species is native to the mountain ranges of\\n\\nCentral and\\n\\nSouth Asia. It is listed as\\n\\nVulnerable on the\\n\\nIUCN Red List because the global population is estimated to number fewer than 10,000 mature individuals and is expected to decline about 10% by 2040. It is mainly threatened by\\n\\npoaching and\\n\\nhabitat destruction following infrastructural developments. It inhabits\\n\\nalpine and\\n\\nsubalpine zones at elevations of 3,000‚Äì4,500\\xa0m (9,800‚Äì14,800\\xa0ft), ranging from eastern\\n\\nAfghanistan, the\\n\\nHimalayas and the\\n\\nTibetan Plateau to southern\\n\\nSiberia,\\n\\nMongolia and\\n\\nwestern China. In the northern part of its range, it also lives at lower elevations.\\n\\nTaxonomically, the snow leopard was long classified in the\\n\\nmonotypic genus\\n\\nphylogenetic studies revealed the relationships among\\n\\ngenus.

Its small rounded ears help to minimize heat loss. Their broad paws well distribute the body weight for walking on snow, and have fur on their undersides to enhance the grip on steep and unstable surfaces; they also help to minimize heat loss. Its long and flexible tail helps to balance the cat in the rocky terrain.

Then it drags the prey to a safe location and consumes all edible parts of the carcass. It can survive on a single Himalayan blue sheep for two weeks before hunting again, and one adult individual apparently needs 20‚Äì30 adult blue sheep per year.[1][27] Snow leopards have been recorded to hunt successfully in pairs, especially mating pairs.[50]\\n\\n[27]\\n\\nAlmaty in Kazakhstan, and neither were fatal.

In captivity they can live for up to 25 years.\\n\\nOestrus typically lasts five to eight days, and males tend not to seek out another partner after mating, probably because the short mating season does not allow sufficient time. Paired snow leopards mate in\\n\\nthe usual felid posture, from 12 to 36 times a day. They are unusual among large cats in that they have a well-defined birth peak. They usually\\n\\nmate in late winter, marked by a noticeable increase in marking and calling. Females have a\\n\\ngestation period of 90‚Äì100 days, and the cubs are born between April and June.\\n\\n[27]\\n\\nlitter usually consists of two to three cubs, in exceptional cases there can be up to seven.\\n\\n[51]\\n\\nThe female gives birth in a rocky den or crevice lined with fur shed from her underside. The cubs are born blind and helpless, although already with a thick coat of fur, and weigh 320 to 567\\xa0g (11.3 to 20.0\\xa0oz). Their eyes open at around seven days, and the cubs can walk at five weeks and are fully weaned by 10 weeks. The cubs leave the den when they are around two to four months of age.[27] Three radio-collared snow leopards in Mongolia\\'s Tost Mountains gave birth between late April and late June. Two female cubs started to part from their mothers at the age of 20 to 21 months, but reunited with them several times for a few days over a period of 4‚Äì7 months. One male cub separated from its mother at the age of about 22 months, but stayed in her vicinity for a month and moved out of his natal range at 23 months of age.[53]\\n\\nThe snow leopard has a generation length of eight years.[54]\\n\\nThreats\\n\\n[1]\\n\\nconfiscated, 330\\n\\ntraps were destroyed and 110 poachers were arrested in Kyrgyzstan.\\n\\nUndercover operations in the country revealed an illegal trade network with links to Russia and China via Kazakhstan.

The islands have thousands of plant and animal species, of which the vast majority are endemic. The archipelago‚Äôs arid lowlands are covered by an open cactus forest. A transition zone at higher elevations is covered with a forest in which pisonia (a four o‚Äôclock plant) and guava trees dominate, and the moist forest region above the transition zone is dominated by a Scalesia forest with dense underbrush.

The close\\n\\naffinities of Galapagos animals to the fauna of South and\\n\\nCentral America indicate that most of the islands‚Äô species originated there. Because of subsequent evolutionary\\n\\nadaptations, an amazing range of subspecies are found on the islands today.\\n\\nGalapagos finches, for example, have developed a multitude of adaptive types from one common ancestral type; their subspecies now differ mainly in beak shape and size. The swimming marine\\n\\niguanas, which feed on seaweed and in some places cover the coastal rocks by the hundreds, are unique and endemic. Another species of interest is the flightless cormorant. In addition, penguins and fur seals live on the islands side by side with tropical animals. A geologic study published in 1992 suggested that underwater seamounts near the Galapagos had formed islands between 5,000,000 and 9,000,000 years ago; this helped explain the great amount of endemic speciation, which many biologists believe could not have occurred in a lesser amount of time. The existing Galapagos Islands were formed between 700,000 and 5,000,000 years ago, making them geologically young.\\n\\nGalapagos Islands: Sierra Negra\\n\\nSierra Negra (‚ÄúBlack Range‚Äù), Isabela Island, Galapagos National Park, Ecuador.\\n\\n(more)\\n\\nThe islands‚Äô human inhabitants, mostly Ecuadorans, live in settlements on San Crist√≥bal, Santa Mar√≠a, Isabela, and Santa Cruz islands; Baltra has an Ecuadoran military base.

       " Document(page_content='PENGUINS\\n\\nWatching penguins waddle across slippery ice or huddle together for warmth will melt the most frozen of hearts. Here at BirdLife, we can‚Äôt imagine a world without penguins. But despite their charm and worldwide popularity, they are marching toward extinction.\\n\\nPenguins are sadly one of the most threatened groups of seabirds, with half of the 18 species listed by Birdlife as either Vulnerable or Endangered.\\n\\nWhile penguins are well adapted to their environments, human impacts are hitting their homes too hard and too fast for them to cope. The threats are numerous, including habitat loss, pollution, disease, and reduced food availability due to commercial fishing. Climate change is of particular concern for many species of penguin, as the sea ice that they depend on to find food or build nests is melting before their eyes.\\n\\nShare\\n\\nFamily: Spheniscidae\\n\\nDiet: Carnivore\\n\\nLife span: 15‚Äì20 years\\n\\nWeight: 1 ‚Äì 40 kg\\n\\nGroup name: colony, rookery, or waddle (on land), raft (at sea)\\n\\nSpecies information\\n\\nLearn more about each species of penguin and all other birds on our Datazone\\n\\nExplore the Datazone\\n\\nDid you know?\\n\\nMost penguins live around frozen Antarctica, where they experience some of the most extreme conditions on Earth. When it‚Äôs particularly cold, large groups of penguins ‚Äì sometimes in the millions! ‚Äì will huddle for warmth, rotating so each one gets a turn in the warm middle. This behaviour among Emperor penguins is so effective that it can cut heat loss by a half, with the inside reaching a toasty 37.5 ¬∞C. Though most people associate penguins with snow and ice, they can also be spotted in forests in New Zealand, on volcanic islands of the Galapagos, and beaches of southern Africa.\\n\\nPenguins may not be able to fly, but they more than make up for it with their swimming skills ‚Äì necessary as they spend most of their lives in the water. With flippers instead of wings, penguins can swim 15 miles an hour and do most of their hunting in the deep where they catch krill, squid, and fish. On land, they stand upright and waddle or run, or when in a hurry can switch to ‚Äòtobogganing‚Äô by lying on their stomach and using their flippers to propel, steer, and brake.\\n\\nEmperor penguins are the only penguin species to breed during the cold, dark Antarctic winter. After laying a single egg, the female leaves the male in charge of the egg while she takes a long hunting trip. Rather than sit on the egg like most birds, the male balances the egg on his feet, protected and kept warm in feathered skin called a brood pouch. The male doesn‚Äôt feed for the whole time the female is away, which can be as long as two months.\\n\\nHow you can help\\n\\nMake a donation\\n\\nOur evidence-backed approach ensures your money will always go where it‚Äôs needed most\\n\\nMake a Donation\\n\\nBecome a species champion\\n\\nJoin the community of Species Champions supporting our work to prevent extinctions\\n\\nFind out more\\n\\nBecome a member\\n\\nBecome a member and join a worldwide community of bird lovers, working to make a real difference\\n\\nJoin today', metadata={'source': 'https://www.birdlife.org/birds/penguins/#:~:text=The%20threats%20are%20numerous%2C%20including,is%20melting%20before%20their%20eyes.', 'title': 'Penguins - BirdLife International', 'description': 'Here at BirdLife, we can‚Äôt imagine a world without penguins.

[34]  History  Main articles:   History of New York City and  Timeline of New York City  Further information:   History of Manhattan,  Timeline of Brooklyn,  Timeline of Queens,  Timeline of the Bronx, and  Timeline of Staten Island  Early history  Main article:   History of New York City (prehistory‚Äì1664)  pre-Columbian era, the area of present-day New York City was inhabited by  Algonquians, including the  Lenape. Their homeland, known as  Lenapehoking, included the present-day areas of  Staten Island,  Manhattan,  the Bronx, the western portion of  Long Island (including  Brooklyn and  Queens), and the  Lower Hudson Valley.

[37]  Est√™v√£o Gomes sailing for  Emperor Charles\\xa0V, arrived in New York Harbor in January 1525 and charted the mouth of the  Hudson River, which he named  R√≠o de San Antonio (\\'Saint Anthony\\'s River\\').

The first non‚ÄìNative American inhabitant of what became New York City was  Juan Rodriguez, a merchant from  Santo Domingo who arrived in Manhattan during the winter of 1613‚Äì14, trapping for  pelts and trading with the local population as a representative of the Dutch colonists.

In 1625, construction was started on a  citadel and  Fort Amsterdam, later called  [43]  [44]  Lower Manhattan. Its area extended from the southern tip of Manhattan to modern-day  Wall Street, where a 12-foot (3.7\\xa0m) wooden  stockade was built in 1653 to protect against Native American and English raids.  [45]  Peter Minuit, acting as charged by the  Dutch West India Company, purchased the island of Manhattan from the  [46]  guilders\"  [47]  [48]  [49]  [50]  Following the purchase, New Amsterdam grew slowly.[24] To attract settlers, the Dutch instituted the patroon system in 1628, whereby wealthy Dutchmen (patroons, or patrons) who brought 50 colonists to New Netherland would be awarded swaths of land, along with local political autonomy and rights to participate in the lucrative fur trade. This program had little success.[51]  Since 1621, the Dutch West India Company had operated as a monopoly in New Netherland, on authority granted by the Dutch States General. In 1639‚Äì1640, in an effort to bolster economic growth, the Dutch West India Company relinquished its monopoly over the fur trade, leading to growth in the production and trade of food, timber, tobacco, and slaves (particularly with the Dutch West Indies).[24][52]  Peter Stuyvesant began his tenure as the last  Director-General of New Netherland.

For other uses, see   Snow Leopard (disambiguation).  Snow leopard  Conservation status Vulnerable ( IUCN 3.1 ) [1] CITES Appendix I ( CITES ) [1] Scientific classification Domain: Eukaryota Kingdom: Animalia Phylum: Chordata Class: Mammalia Order: Carnivora Suborder: Feliformia Family: Felidae Subfamily: Pantherinae Genus: Panthera Species: P.\\xa0uncia Binomial name Panthera uncia ( Schreber , 1775)  Distribution of the snow leopard, 2017 [1] Synonyms Felis uncia Schreber , 1777 Felis irbis Ehrenberg , 1830 Felis uncioides Horsfield , 1855 Uncia uncia Pocock , 1930 Panthera baikalensis-romanii Medvedev, 2000  species of large cat in the genus  Panthera  family  Felidae. The species is native to the mountain ranges of  Central and  South Asia. It is listed as  Vulnerable on the  IUCN Red List because the global population is estimated to number fewer than 10,000 mature individuals and is expected to decline about 10% by 2040. It is mainly threatened by  poaching and  habitat destruction following infrastructural developments. It inhabits  alpine and  subalpine zones at elevations of 3,000‚Äì4,500\\xa0m (9,800‚Äì14,800\\xa0ft), ranging from eastern  Afghanistan, the  Himalayas and the  Tibetan Plateau to southern  Siberia,  Mongolia and  western China. In the northern part of its range, it also lives at lower elevations.  Taxonomically, the snow leopard was long classified in the  monotypic genus  phylogenetic studies revealed the relationships among  genus. Two subspecies were described based on  morphological differences, but  genetic differences between the two have not yet been confirmed. It is therefore regarded as a  monotypic species. The species is widely depicted in  Kyrgyz culture.  Naming and etymology  Old French word once, which was intended to be used for the  Eurasian lynx (  Latin name  false splitting. The word once was originally considered to be pronounced as  elided form of the word  [2]  classical Latin  ancient Greek œÄŒ¨ŒΩŒ∏Œ∑œÅ  [3]  Taxonomy and evolution  skull in the collection of the  Museum Wiesbaden  scientific name used by  Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber in 1777 who  described a snow leopard based on an earlier description by  Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, assuming that the cat occurred along the  Barbary Coast, in  Persia,  East India and  China.

[11]  [12]  [13]  [14]  Until spring 2017, there was no evidence available for the recognition of subspecies. Results of a phylogeographic analysis indicate that three subspecies should be recognised:[15]  P. u. uncia in the range countries of the Pamir Mountains  P. u. irbis in Mongolia, and  P. u. uncioides in the Himalayas and Qinghai.  This view has been both contested and supported by different researchers.[16][17][18][19]  Additionally, an extinct subspecies Panthera uncia pyrenaica was described in 2022 based on material found in France.[20]  Evolution  [11]  [21]  [12]  [22]  DNA sequence sampled across the living  Felidae, the snow leopard forms a  sister group with the  tiger (  genetic divergence time of this group is estimated at  4.62\\xa0to\\xa01.82 million years ago.

[24]  Characteristics  Showing canines  Thickly furred tail  rosettes on the back,  flanks and bushy tail. Its  muzzle is short, its forehead domed, and its  nasal cavities are large. The fur is thick with hairs measuring 5 to 12\\xa0cm (2.0 to 4.7\\xa0in) in length, and its underbelly is whitish. They are stocky, short-legged, and slightly smaller than other cats of the genus  [25]  [26]  [27]  canine teeth are 28.6\\xa0mm (1.13\\xa0in) long and are more slender than those of the other  [28]  skull and width of their  palate, they have large nasal openings, which allow for increasing the volume of air inhaled with each breath, and at the same time for warming and humidifying cold dry air.  [29]  high-altitude hypoxia.  [30]  The snow leopard shows several adaptations for living in a cold, mountainous environments. Its small rounded ears help to minimize heat loss. Their broad paws well distribute the body weight for walking on snow, and have fur on their undersides to enhance the grip on steep and unstable surfaces; they also help to minimize heat loss. Its long and flexible tail helps to balance the cat in the rocky terrain. The tail is very thick due to fat storage, and is covered in a thick layer of fur, which allows the cat to use it like a blanket to protect its face when asleep.[31][32]  forehead, a vertical chin and a less developed posterior process of the lower  jaw.

[34]  [35]  Distribution and habitat  Lake Baikal through southern Siberia, in the  Kunlun Mountains, Altai Mountains,  Sayan and  Tannu-Ola Mountains, in the  Tian Shan, through  Tajikistan,  Kyrgyzstan,  Uzbekistan and  Kazakhstan to the  Hindu Kush in eastern Afghanistan,  Karakoram in northern  Pakistan, in the  Pamir Mountains, the Tibetan Plateau and in the high elevations of the  Himalayas in  India,  Nepal and  Bhutan. In Mongolia, they inhabit the Mongolian and Gobi Altai Mountains and the  Khangai Mountains. In  Tibet, they occur up to the  Altyn-Tagh in the north.

[38]  In summer, the snow leopard usually lives above the tree line on alpine meadows and in rocky regions at elevations of 2,700 to 6,000\\xa0m (8,900 to 19,700\\xa0ft). In winter, they descend to elevations around 1,200 to 2,000\\xa0m (3,900 to 6,600\\xa0ft). They prefer rocky, broken terrain, and can move in 85\\xa0cm (33\\xa0in) deep snow, but prefers to use existing trails made by other animals.[27]  Snow leopards were recorded by camera traps at 16 locations in northeastern Afghanistan\\'s isolated Wakhan Corridor.[39]  Behavior and ecology  Scent rubbing  The snow leopard\\'s vocalizations include meowing, grunting, prusten and moaning. They can purr when exhaling.[25]  solitary and mostly active at dawn till early morning, and again in afternoons and early evenings. They mostly rest near cliffs and ridges that provide vantage points and shade. In Nepal\\'s  Shey Phoksundo National Park, the home ranges of five adult  radio-collared snow leopards largely overlapped, though they rarely met. Their individual home ranges ranged from 12 to 39\\xa0km  [40]  [41]  A study in the Gobi Desert from 2008 to 2014 revealed that adult males used a mean home range of 144‚Äì270\\xa0km2 (56‚Äì104\\xa0sq\\xa0mi), while adult females ranged in areas of 83‚Äì165\\xa0km2 (32‚Äì64\\xa0sq\\xa0mi). Their home ranges overlapped less than 20%. These results indicate that about 40% of the 170 protected areas in their range countries are smaller than the home range of a single male snow leopard.[42]  scent marks to indicate their territories and common travel routes. They scrape the ground with the hind feet before depositing  urine or  feces, but also  spray urine onto rocks.

[43]  Hunting and diet  Snow leopard with a   gray marmot in Kyrgyzstan  carnivore and actively  hunts its  prey. Its preferred wild prey species are  Himalayan blue sheep (  Himalayan tahr (  argali (  markhor (  wild goat (  [44]  [45]  Himalayan marmot (  pika and  vole species. Its diet depends on prey availability and varies across its range and season. In the Himalayas, it preys mostly on Himalayan blue sheep,  Siberian ibex (  white-bellied musk deer (  wild boar (  Karakoram,  Tian Shan, Altai and Mongolia\\'s Tost Mountains, its main prey consists of Siberian ibex,  Thorold\\'s deer (  Siberian roe deer (  [46]  [47]  rhesus macaque (  masked palm civet (  Cape hare (  house mouse (  Kashmir field mouse (  grey dwarf hamster (  Turkestan rat (  [48]  woolly flying squirrel (  Gangotri National Park.

[27]  The snow leopard actively pursues prey down steep mountainsides, using the momentum of its initial leap to chase animals for up to 300\\xa0m (980\\xa0ft). Then it drags the prey to a safe location and consumes all edible parts of the carcass. It can survive on a single Himalayan blue sheep for two weeks before hunting again, and one adult individual apparently needs 20‚Äì30 adult blue sheep per year.[1][27] Snow leopards have been recorded to hunt successfully in pairs, especially mating pairs.[50]  [27]  Almaty in Kazakhstan, and neither were fatal. In 1940, a  rabid snow leopard attacked two men; and an old, toothless  emaciated individual attacked a person passing by.  [51]  [52]  Reproduction and life cycle  Cubs at the Cat Survival Trust in   Welwyn  Female with her cub in   Zurich Zoo  sexually mature at two to three years, and normally live for 15‚Äì18 years in the wild. In captivity they can live for up to 25 years.  Oestrus typically lasts five to eight days, and males tend not to seek out another partner after mating, probably because the short mating season does not allow sufficient time. Paired snow leopards mate in  the usual felid posture, from 12 to 36 times a day. They are unusual among large cats in that they have a well-defined birth peak. They usually  mate in late winter, marked by a noticeable increase in marking and calling. Females have a  gestation period of 90‚Äì100 days, and the cubs are born between April and June.  [27]  litter usually consists of two to three cubs, in exceptional cases there can be up to seven.  [51]  The female gives birth in a rocky den or crevice lined with fur shed from her underside. The cubs are born blind and helpless, although already with a thick coat of fur, and weigh 320 to 567\\xa0g (11.3 to 20.0\\xa0oz). Their eyes open at around seven days, and the cubs can walk at five weeks and are fully weaned by 10 weeks. The cubs leave the den when they are around two to four months of age.[27] Three radio-collared snow leopards in Mongolia\\'s Tost Mountains gave birth between late April and late June. Two female cubs started to part from their mothers at the age of 20 to 21 months, but reunited with them several times for a few days over a period of 4‚Äì7 months. One male cub separated from its mother at the age of about 22 months, but stayed in her vicinity for a month and moved out of his natal range at 23 months of age.[53]  The snow leopard has a generation length of eight years.[54]  Threats  [1]  confiscated, 330  traps were destroyed and 110 poachers were arrested in Kyrgyzstan.  Undercover operations in the country revealed an illegal trade network with links to Russia and China via Kazakhstan. The major skin trade center in the region is the city of  Kashgar in  Xinjiang.  [55]  traditional Tibetan medicine to cure  kidney problems; bones are used in  traditional Chinese and  Mongolian medicine for treating  rheumatism, injuries and pain of human bones and  tendons. Between 1996 and 2002, 37 skins were found in wildlife markets and tourist shops in Mongolia.  [56]  [57]  [58]  Greenhouse gas emissions will likely cause a shift of the treeline in the Himalayas and a shrinking of the alpine zone, which may reduce snow leopard habitat by an estimated 30%.[59]  Where snow leopards prey on domestic livestock, they are subject to human‚Äìwildlife conflict.[1]  The loss of natural prey due to overgrazing by livestock, poaching, and defense of livestock are the major drivers for the ever decreasing snow leopard population.[27] Livestock also cause habitat degradation, which, alongside the increasing use of forests for fuel, reduces snow leopard habitat.[60]  Conservation  Country Year Estimate Afghanistan 2016 50‚Äì200 [61] Bhutan 2016 79‚Äì112 [62] China 2016 4,500 [63] India 2016 516‚Äì524 [64] Kazakhstan 2016 100‚Äì120 [65] Kyrgyzstan 2016 300‚Äì400 [66] Mongolia 2016 1,000 [67] Nepal 2016 301‚Äì400 [68] Pakistan 2016 250-420 [69] Russia 2016 70‚Äì90 [70] Tajikistan 2016 250‚Äì280 [71] Uzbekistan 2016 30‚Äì120 [72]  CITES Appendix I.

[75]  [62]  At the end of 2020, 35 cameras were installed on the outskirts of Almaty, Kazakhstan in hopes to catch footage of snow leopards. In November 2021, it was announced by the Russian World Wildlife Fund (WWF) that snow leopards were spotted 65 times on these cameras in the Trans-Ili Alatau mountains since the cameras were installed.[76][42][77][78][79]  Global Snow Leopard Forum  Almazbek Atambayev, and the State Agency on Environmental Protection and Forestry under the government of Kyrgyzstan. The meeting was held in  Bishkek, and all countries agreed that the snow leopard and the high mountain habitat need trans-boundary support to ensure a viable future for snow leopard populations, and to safeguard its fragile environment. The event brought together many partners, including  NGOs like the  Snow Leopard Conservancy, the  Snow Leopard Trust, and the  Nature and Biodiversity Conservation Union. Also supporting the initiative were the Snow Leopard Network, the  World Bank\\'s  Global Tiger Initiative, the  United Nations Development Programme, the  World Wild Fund for Nature, the  United States Agency for International Development, and  Global Environment Facility.  [80]  In captivity  San Diego Zoo  Moscow Zoo exhibited the first captive snow leopard in 1872 that had been caught in  Turkestan. In Kyrgyzstan, 420 live snow leopards were caught between 1936 and 1988 and exported to zoos around the world. The  Bronx Zoo housed a live snow leopard in 1903; this was the first ever specimen exhibited in a North American zoo.  [81]  captive bred snow leopard cubs were born in the 1990s in the  Beijing Zoo.  [55]  Species Survival Plan was initiated in 1984; by 1986,  American zoos held 234 individuals.

In Kyrgyzstan, they have been used in highly stylized form in the modern emblem of the capital  Bishkek, and the same art has been integrated into the badge of the  Kyrgyzstan Girl Scouts Association. They are also considered to be a sacred creature by the  Kyrgyz people. A crowned snow leopard features in the arms of  Shushensky District in Russia.

Their total land area of 3,093 square miles (8,010 square km) is scattered over 23,000 square miles (59,500 square km) of ocean. The government of Ecuador designated part of the Galapagos a wildlife sanctuary in 1935, and in 1959 the sanctuary became the  Galapagos National Park. In 1978 the islands were designated a  UNESCO  World Heritage site, and in 1986 the Galapagos Marine Resources Reserve was created to protect the surrounding waters.

The striking ruggedness of the arid landscape is accentuated by high volcanic mountains, craters, and cliffs. The largest of the islands,  Isabela (Albemarle), is approximately 82 miles (132 km) long and  constitutes more than half of the total land area of the archipelago; it contains  Mount Azul, at 5,541 feet (1,689 metres) the highest point of the Galapagos Islands.

The islands became internationally famous as a result of their being visited in 1835 by the English naturalist  Charles Darwin; their unusual fauna contributed to the groundbreaking theories on  natural selection presented in his  Sally Lightfoot crab (Grapsus grapsus), Galapagos National Park, Galapagos Islands, Ecuador.  The climate of the Galapagos Islands is characterized by low rainfall, low humidity, and relatively low air and water temperatures. The islands have thousands of plant and animal species, of which the vast majority are endemic. The archipelago‚Äôs arid lowlands are covered by an open cactus forest. A transition zone at higher elevations is covered with a forest in which pisonia (a four o‚Äôclock plant) and guava trees dominate, and the moist forest region above the transition zone is dominated by a Scalesia forest with dense underbrush.

The close  affinities of Galapagos animals to the fauna of South and  Central America indicate that most of the islands‚Äô species originated there. Because of subsequent evolutionary  adaptations, an amazing range of subspecies are found on the islands today.  Galapagos finches, for example, have developed a multitude of adaptive types from one common ancestral type; their subspecies now differ mainly in beak shape and size. The swimming marine  iguanas, which feed on seaweed and in some places cover the coastal rocks by the hundreds, are unique and endemic. Another species of interest is the flightless cormorant. In addition, penguins and fur seals live on the islands side by side with tropical animals. A geologic study published in 1992 suggested that underwater seamounts near the Galapagos had formed islands between 5,000,000 and 9,000,000 years ago; this helped explain the great amount of endemic speciation, which many biologists believe could not have occurred in a lesser amount of time. The existing Galapagos Islands were formed between 700,000 and 5,000,000 years ago, making them geologically young.

       " 'PENGUINS  Watching penguins waddle across slippery ice or huddle together for warmth will melt the most frozen of hearts. Here at BirdLife, we can‚Äôt imagine a world without penguins. But despite their charm and worldwide popularity, they are marching toward extinction.  Penguins are sadly one of the most threatened groups of seabirds, with half of the 18 species listed by Birdlife as either Vulnerable or Endangered.  While penguins are well adapted to their environments, human impacts are hitting their homes too hard and too fast for them to cope. The threats are numerous, including habitat loss, pollution, disease, and reduced food availability due to commercial fishing. Climate change is of particular concern for many species of penguin, as the sea ice that they depend on to find food or build nests is melting before their eyes.  Share  Family: Spheniscidae  Diet: Carnivore  Life span: 15‚Äì20 years  Weight: 1 ‚Äì 40 kg  Group name: colony, rookery, or waddle (on land), raft (at sea)  Species information  Learn more about each species of penguin and all other birds on our Datazone  Explore the Datazone  Did you know?  Most penguins live around frozen Antarctica, where they experience some of the most extreme conditions on Earth. When it‚Äôs particularly cold, large groups of penguins ‚Äì sometimes in the millions! ‚Äì will huddle for warmth, rotating so each one gets a turn in the warm middle. This behaviour among Emperor penguins is so effective that it can cut heat loss by a half, with the inside reaching a toasty 37.5 ¬∞C. Though most people associate penguins with snow and ice, they can also be spotted in forests in New Zealand, on volcanic islands of the Galapagos, and beaches of southern Africa.  Penguins may not be able to fly, but they more than make up for it with their swimming skills ‚Äì necessary as they spend most of their lives in the water. With flippers instead of wings, penguins can swim 15 miles an hour and do most of their hunting in the deep where they catch krill, squid, and fish. On land, they stand upright and waddle or run, or when in a hurry can switch to ‚Äòtobogganing‚Äô by lying on their stomach and using their flippers to propel, steer, and brake.  Emperor penguins are the only penguin species to breed during the cold, dark Antarctic winter. After laying a single egg, the female leaves the male in charge of the egg while she takes a long hunting trip. Rather than sit on the egg like most birds, the male balances the egg on his feet, protected and kept warm in feathered skin called a brood pouch. The male doesn‚Äôt feed for the whole time the female is away, which can be as long as two months.

Their homeland, known as  Lenapehoking, included the present-day areas of  Staten Island,  Manhattan,  the Bronx, the western portion of  Long Island (including  Brooklyn and  Queens), and the  Lower Hudson Valley. [35]  New York Harbor by a European was in 1524 by  Giovanni da\\xa0Verrazzano, an explorer from  Florence in the service of the  French crown. [36]  New Angoul√™me). [37]  Est√™v√£o Gomes sailing for  Emperor Charles\\xa0V, arrived in New York Harbor in January 1525 and charted the mouth of the  Hudson River, which he named  R√≠o de San Antonio (\\'Saint Anthony\\'s River\\').

The first non‚ÄìNative American inhabitant of what became New York City was  Juan Rodriguez, a merchant from  Santo Domingo who arrived in Manhattan during the winter of 1613‚Äì14, trapping for  pelts and trading with the local population as a representative of the Dutch colonists.

In 1625, construction was started on a  citadel and  Fort Amsterdam, later called  [43]  [44]  Lower Manhattan. Its area extended from the southern tip of Manhattan to modern-day  Wall Street, where a 12-foot (3.7\\xa0m) wooden  stockade was built in 1653 to protect against Native American and English raids. [45]  Peter Minuit, acting as charged by the  Dutch West India Company, purchased the island of Manhattan from the  [46]  guilders\"  [47]  [48]  [49]  [50]  Following the purchase, New Amsterdam grew slowly.[24] To attract settlers, the Dutch instituted the patroon system in 1628, whereby wealthy Dutchmen (patroons, or patrons) who brought 50 colonists to New Netherland would be awarded swaths of land, along with local political autonomy and rights to participate in the lucrative fur trade. This program had little success.[51]  Since 1621, the Dutch West India Company had operated as a monopoly in New Netherland, on authority granted by the Dutch States General. In 1639‚Äì1640, in an effort to bolster economic growth, the Dutch West India Company relinquished its monopoly over the fur trade, leading to growth in the production and trade of food, timber, tobacco, and slaves (particularly with the Dutch West Indies).[24][52]  Peter Stuyvesant began his tenure as the last  Director-General of New Netherland.

Snow leopard  Conservation status Vulnerable ( IUCN 3.1 ) [1] CITES Appendix I ( CITES ) [1] Scientific classification Domain: Eukaryota Kingdom: Animalia Phylum: Chordata Class: Mammalia Order: Carnivora Suborder: Feliformia Family: Felidae Subfamily: Pantherinae Genus: Panthera Species: P. uncia Binomial name Panthera uncia ( Schreber , 1775)  Distribution of the snow leopard, 2017 [1] Synonyms Felis uncia Schreber , 1777 Felis irbis Ehrenberg , 1830 Felis uncioides Horsfield , 1855 Uncia uncia Pocock , 1930 Panthera baikalensis-romanii Medvedev, 2000  species of large cat in the genus  Panthera  family  Felidae. The species is native to the mountain ranges of  Central and  South Asia. It is listed as  Vulnerable on the  IUCN Red List because the global population is estimated to number fewer than 10,000 mature individuals and is expected to decline about 10% by 2040. It is mainly threatened by  poaching and  habitat destruction following infrastructural developments. It inhabits  alpine and  subalpine zones at elevations of 3,000‚Äì4,500\\xa0m (9,800‚Äì14,800\\xa0ft), ranging from eastern  Afghanistan, the  Himalayas and the  Tibetan Plateau to southern  Siberia,  Mongolia and  western China. In the northern part of its range, it also lives at lower elevations. Taxonomically, the snow leopard was long classified in the  monotypic genus  phylogenetic studies revealed the relationships among  genus. Two subspecies were described based on  morphological differences, but  genetic differences between the two have not yet been confirmed. It is therefore regarded as a  monotypic species. The species is widely depicted in  Kyrgyz culture. Naming and etymology  Old French word once, which was intended to be used for the  Eurasian lynx (  Latin name  false splitting. The word once was originally considered to be pronounced as  elided form of the word  [2]  classical Latin  ancient Greek œÄŒ¨ŒΩŒ∏Œ∑œÅ  [3]  Taxonomy and evolution  skull in the collection of the  Museum Wiesbaden  scientific name used by  Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber in 1777 who  described a snow leopard based on an earlier description by  Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, assuming that the cat occurred along the  Barbary Coast, in  Persia,  East India and  China. [4]  genus name  John Edward Gray in 1854 for Asian cats with a long and thick tail. [5]  Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg in 1830, was a skin of a female snow leopard collected in the  Altai Mountains. He also clarified that several  leopard (  [6]  Thomas Horsfield in 1855 was a snow leopard skin from Nepal in the collection of the Museum of the  East India Company.

[11]  [12]  [13]  [14]  Until spring 2017, there was no evidence available for the recognition of subspecies. Results of a phylogeographic analysis indicate that three subspecies should be recognised:[15]  P. u. uncia in the range countries of the Pamir Mountains  P. u. irbis in Mongolia, and  P. u. uncioides in the Himalayas and Qinghai. This view has been both contested and supported by different researchers.[16][17][18][19]  Additionally, an extinct subspecies Panthera uncia pyrenaica was described in 2022 based on material found in France.[20]  Evolution  [11]  [21]  [12]  [22]  DNA sequence sampled across the living  Felidae, the snow leopard forms a  sister group with the  tiger (  genetic divergence time of this group is estimated at  4.62\\xa0to\\xa01.82 million years ago. [11]  [21]  3.7\\xa0to\\xa02.7 million years ago. [12]  Panthera blytheae  excavated in western Tibet\\'s  Ngari Prefecture is the oldest known  [23]  mitochondrial genomes of the snow leopard, the leopard and the  lion (  nuclear genomes, indicating that their ancestors  hybridised at some point in their  evolution. [24]  Characteristics  Showing canines  Thickly furred tail  rosettes on the back,  flanks and bushy tail. Its  muzzle is short, its forehead domed, and its  nasal cavities are large. The fur is thick with hairs measuring 5 to 12\\xa0cm (2.0 to 4.7\\xa0in) in length, and its underbelly is whitish. They are stocky, short-legged, and slightly smaller than other cats of the genus  [25]  [26]  [27]  canine teeth are 28.6\\xa0mm (1.13\\xa0in) long and are more slender than those of the other  [28]  skull and width of their  palate, they have large nasal openings, which allow for increasing the volume of air inhaled with each breath, and at the same time for warming and humidifying cold dry air. [29]  high-altitude hypoxia. [30]  The snow leopard shows several adaptations for living in a cold, mountainous environments. Its small rounded ears help to minimize heat loss. Their broad paws well distribute the body weight for walking on snow, and have fur on their undersides to enhance the grip on steep and unstable surfaces; they also help to minimize heat loss. Its long and flexible tail helps to balance the cat in the rocky terrain. The tail is very thick due to fat storage, and is covered in a thick layer of fur, which allows the cat to use it like a blanket to protect its face when asleep.[31][32]  forehead, a vertical chin and a less developed posterior process of the lower  jaw. [33]  roar despite its partly  ossified  hyoid bone, as their 9\\xa0mm (0.35\\xa0in) short  vocal folds provide little resistance to airflow. [34]  [35]  Distribution and habitat  Lake Baikal through southern Siberia, in the  Kunlun Mountains, Altai Mountains,  Sayan and  Tannu-Ola Mountains, in the  Tian Shan, through  Tajikistan,  Kyrgyzstan,  Uzbekistan and  Kazakhstan to the  Hindu Kush in eastern Afghanistan,  Karakoram in northern  Pakistan, in the  Pamir Mountains, the Tibetan Plateau and in the high elevations of the  Himalayas in  India,  Nepal and  Bhutan. In Mongolia, they inhabit the Mongolian and Gobi Altai Mountains and the  Khangai Mountains. In  Tibet, they occur up to the  Altyn-Tagh in the north. [26]  [36]  alpine and  subalpine zones at elevations of 3,000 to 4,500\\xa0m (9,800 to 14,800\\xa0ft), but also lives at lower elevations in the northern part of their range. [37]  Jammu and Kashmir,  Ladakh,  Uttarakhand,  Himachal Pradesh,  Sikkim and  Arunachal Pradesh, of which about 34,000\\xa0km  [36]  Ladakh, 124 in  Uttarakhand, 51 in Himachal Pradesh, 36 in Arunachal Pradesh, 21 in Sikkim, and nine in Jammu and Kashmir. [38]  In summer, the snow leopard usually lives above the tree line on alpine meadows and in rocky regions at elevations of 2,700 to 6,000\\xa0m (8,900 to 19,700\\xa0ft). In winter, they descend to elevations around 1,200 to 2,000\\xa0m (3,900 to 6,600\\xa0ft). They prefer rocky, broken terrain, and can move in 85\\xa0cm (33\\xa0in) deep snow, but prefers to use existing trails made by other animals.[27]  Snow leopards were recorded by camera traps at 16 locations in northeastern Afghanistan\\'s isolated Wakhan Corridor.[39]  Behavior and ecology  Scent rubbing  The snow leopard\\'s vocalizations include meowing, grunting, prusten and moaning. They can purr when exhaling.[25]  solitary and mostly active at dawn till early morning, and again in afternoons and early evenings. They mostly rest near cliffs and ridges that provide vantage points and shade. In Nepal\\'s  Shey Phoksundo National Park, the home ranges of five adult  radio-collared snow leopards largely overlapped, though they rarely met. Their individual home ranges ranged from 12 to 39\\xa0km  [40]  [41]  A study in the Gobi Desert from 2008 to 2014 revealed that adult males used a mean home range of 144‚Äì270\\xa0km2 (56‚Äì104\\xa0sq\\xa0mi), while adult females ranged in areas of 83‚Äì165\\xa0km2 (32‚Äì64\\xa0sq\\xa0mi). Their home ranges overlapped less than 20%. These results indicate that about 40% of the 170 protected areas in their range countries are smaller than the home range of a single male snow leopard.[42]  scent marks to indicate their territories and common travel routes. They scrape the ground with the hind feet before depositing  urine or  feces, but also  spray urine onto rocks.

[43]  Hunting and diet  Snow leopard with a   gray marmot in Kyrgyzstan  carnivore and actively  hunts its  prey. Its preferred wild prey species are  Himalayan blue sheep (  Himalayan tahr (  argali (  markhor (  wild goat (  [44]  [45]  Himalayan marmot (  pika and  vole species. Its diet depends on prey availability and varies across its range and season. In the Himalayas, it preys mostly on Himalayan blue sheep,  Siberian ibex (  white-bellied musk deer (  wild boar (  Karakoram,  Tian Shan, Altai and Mongolia\\'s Tost Mountains, its main prey consists of Siberian ibex,  Thorold\\'s deer (  Siberian roe deer (  [46]  [47]  rhesus macaque (  masked palm civet (  Cape hare (  house mouse (  Kashmir field mouse (  grey dwarf hamster (  Turkestan rat (  [48]  woolly flying squirrel (  Gangotri National Park. [49]  domestic sheep comprises less than 20% of its diet, although wild prey has been reduced and interactions with people are common. [47]  wild yak. It also eats grass and twigs. [27]  The snow leopard actively pursues prey down steep mountainsides, using the momentum of its initial leap to chase animals for up to 300\\xa0m (980\\xa0ft). Then it drags the prey to a safe location and consumes all edible parts of the carcass. It can survive on a single Himalayan blue sheep for two weeks before hunting again, and one adult individual apparently needs 20‚Äì30 adult blue sheep per year.[1][27] Snow leopards have been recorded to hunt successfully in pairs, especially mating pairs.[50]  [27]  Almaty in Kazakhstan, and neither were fatal. In 1940, a  rabid snow leopard attacked two men; and an old, toothless  emaciated individual attacked a person passing by. [51]  [52]  Reproduction and life cycle  Cubs at the Cat Survival Trust in   Welwyn  Female with her cub in   Zurich Zoo  sexually mature at two to three years, and normally live for 15‚Äì18 years in the wild. In captivity they can live for up to 25 years. Oestrus typically lasts five to eight days, and males tend not to seek out another partner after mating, probably because the short mating season does not allow sufficient time. Paired snow leopards mate in  the usual felid posture, from 12 to 36 times a day. They are unusual among large cats in that they have a well-defined birth peak. They usually  mate in late winter, marked by a noticeable increase in marking and calling. Females have a  gestation period of 90‚Äì100 days, and the cubs are born between April and June. [27]  litter usually consists of two to three cubs, in exceptional cases there can be up to seven. [51]  The female gives birth in a rocky den or crevice lined with fur shed from her underside. The cubs are born blind and helpless, although already with a thick coat of fur, and weigh 320 to 567\\xa0g (11.3 to 20.0\\xa0oz). Their eyes open at around seven days, and the cubs can walk at five weeks and are fully weaned by 10 weeks. The cubs leave the den when they are around two to four months of age.[27] Three radio-collared snow leopards in Mongolia\\'s Tost Mountains gave birth between late April and late June. Two female cubs started to part from their mothers at the age of 20 to 21 months, but reunited with them several times for a few days over a period of 4‚Äì7 months. One male cub separated from its mother at the age of about 22 months, but stayed in her vicinity for a month and moved out of his natal range at 23 months of age.[53]  The snow leopard has a generation length of eight years.[54]  Threats  [1]  confiscated, 330  traps were destroyed and 110 poachers were arrested in Kyrgyzstan. Undercover operations in the country revealed an illegal trade network with links to Russia and China via Kazakhstan. The major skin trade center in the region is the city of  Kashgar in  Xinjiang. [55]  traditional Tibetan medicine to cure  kidney problems; bones are used in  traditional Chinese and  Mongolian medicine for treating  rheumatism, injuries and pain of human bones and  tendons. Between 1996 and 2002, 37 skins were found in wildlife markets and tourist shops in Mongolia. [56]  [57]  [58]  Greenhouse gas emissions will likely cause a shift of the treeline in the Himalayas and a shrinking of the alpine zone, which may reduce snow leopard habitat by an estimated 30%.[59]  Where snow leopards prey on domestic livestock, they are subject to human‚Äìwildlife conflict.[1]  The loss of natural prey due to overgrazing by livestock, poaching, and defense of livestock are the major drivers for the ever decreasing snow leopard population.[27] Livestock also cause habitat degradation, which, alongside the increasing use of forests for fuel, reduces snow leopard habitat.[60]  Conservation  Country Year Estimate Afghanistan 2016 50‚Äì200 [61] Bhutan 2016 79‚Äì112 [62] China 2016 4,500 [63] India 2016 516‚Äì524 [64] Kazakhstan 2016 100‚Äì120 [65] Kyrgyzstan 2016 300‚Äì400 [66] Mongolia 2016 1,000 [67] Nepal 2016 301‚Äì400 [68] Pakistan 2016 250-420 [69] Russia 2016 70‚Äì90 [70] Tajikistan 2016 250‚Äì280 [71] Uzbekistan 2016 30‚Äì120 [72]  CITES Appendix I.

[75]  [62]  At the end of 2020, 35 cameras were installed on the outskirts of Almaty, Kazakhstan in hopes to catch footage of snow leopards. In November 2021, it was announced by the Russian World Wildlife Fund (WWF) that snow leopards were spotted 65 times on these cameras in the Trans-Ili Alatau mountains since the cameras were installed.[76][42][77][78][79]  Global Snow Leopard Forum  Almazbek Atambayev, and the State Agency on Environmental Protection and Forestry under the government of Kyrgyzstan. The meeting was held in  Bishkek, and all countries agreed that the snow leopard and the high mountain habitat need trans-boundary support to ensure a viable future for snow leopard populations, and to safeguard its fragile environment. The event brought together many partners, including  NGOs like the  Snow Leopard Conservancy, the  Snow Leopard Trust, and the  Nature and Biodiversity Conservation Union. Also supporting the initiative were the Snow Leopard Network, the  World Bank\\'s  Global Tiger Initiative, the  United Nations Development Programme, the  World Wild Fund for Nature, the  United States Agency for International Development, and  Global Environment Facility. [80]  In captivity  San Diego Zoo  Moscow Zoo exhibited the first captive snow leopard in 1872 that had been caught in  Turkestan. In Kyrgyzstan, 420 live snow leopards were caught between 1936 and 1988 and exported to zoos around the world. The  Bronx Zoo housed a live snow leopard in 1903; this was the first ever specimen exhibited in a North American zoo. [81]  captive bred snow leopard cubs were born in the 1990s in the  Beijing Zoo.

In Kyrgyzstan, they have been used in highly stylized form in the modern emblem of the capital  Bishkek, and the same art has been integrated into the badge of the  Kyrgyzstan Girl Scouts Association. They are also considered to be a sacred creature by the  Kyrgyz people. A crowned snow leopard features in the arms of  Shushensky District in Russia. It is the  state animal of  Ladakh and  Himachal Pradesh in India.

Here at BirdLife, we can‚Äôt imagine a world without penguins. But despite their charm and worldwide popularity, they are marching toward extinction. Penguins are sadly one of the most threatened groups of seabirds, with half of the 18 species listed by Birdlife as either Vulnerable or Endangered. While penguins are well adapted to their environments, human impacts are hitting their homes too hard and too fast for them to cope. The threats are numerous, including habitat loss, pollution, disease, and reduced food availability due to commercial fishing. Climate change is of particular concern for many species of penguin, as the sea ice that they depend on to find food or build nests is melting before their eyes.

       " Document(page_content='When it‚Äôs particularly cold, large groups of penguins ‚Äì sometimes in the millions! ‚Äì will huddle for warmth, rotating so each one gets a turn in the warm middle. This behaviour among Emperor penguins is so effective that it can cut heat loss by a half, with the inside reaching a toasty 37.5 ¬∞C. Though most people associate penguins with snow and ice, they can also be spotted in forests in New Zealand, on volcanic islands of the Galapagos, and beaches of southern Africa. Penguins may not be able to fly, but they more than make up for it with their swimming skills ‚Äì necessary as they spend most of their lives in the water. With flippers instead of wings, penguins can swim 15 miles an hour and do most of their hunting in the deep where they catch krill, squid, and fish. On land, they stand upright and waddle or run, or when in a hurry can switch to ‚Äòtobogganing‚Äô by lying on their stomach and using their flippers to propel, steer, and brake. Emperor penguins are the only penguin species to breed during the cold, dark Antarctic winter. After laying a single egg, the female leaves the male in charge of the egg while she takes a long hunting trip. Rather than sit on the egg like most birds, the male balances the egg on his feet, protected and kept warm in feathered skin called a brood pouch. The male doesn‚Äôt feed for the whole time the female is away, which can be as long as two months.

       " ['Because of subsequent evolutionary  adaptations, an amazing range of subspecies are found on the islands today. Galapagos finches, for example, have developed a multitude of adaptive types from one common ancestral type; their subspecies now differ mainly in beak shape and size. The swimming marine  iguanas, which feed on seaweed and in some places cover the coastal rocks by the hundreds, are unique and endemic. Another species of interest is the flightless cormorant. In addition, penguins and fur seals live on the islands side by side with tropical animals. A geologic study published in 1992 suggested that underwater seamounts near the Galapagos had formed islands between 5,000,000 and 9,000,000 years ago; this helped explain the great amount of endemic speciation, which many biologists believe could not have occurred in a lesser amount of time. The existing Galapagos Islands were formed between 700,000 and 5,000,000 years ago, making them geologically young.

Its area extended from the southern tip of Manhattan to modern-day  Wall Street, where a 12-foot (3.7\\xa0m) wooden  stockade was built in 1653 to protect against Native American and English raids.

This program had little success.[51]  Since 1621, the Dutch West India Company had operated as a monopoly in New Netherland, on authority granted by the Dutch States General. In 1639‚Äì1640, in an effort to bolster economic growth, the Dutch West India Company relinquished its monopoly over the fur trade, leading to growth in the production and trade of food, timber, tobacco, and slaves (particularly with the Dutch West Indies).[24][52]  Peter Stuyvesant began his tenure as the last  Director-General of New Netherland.

       " ['Because of subsequent evolutionary  adaptations, an amazing range of subspecies are found on the islands today. Galapagos finches, for example, have developed a multitude of adaptive types from one common ancestral type; their subspecies now differ mainly in beak shape and size. The swimming marine  iguanas, which feed on seaweed and in some places cover the coastal rocks by the hundreds, are unique and endemic. Another species of interest is the flightless cormorant. In addition, penguins and fur seals live on the islands side by side with tropical animals. A geologic study published in 1992 suggested that underwater seamounts near the Galapagos had formed islands between 5,000,000 and 9,000,000 years ago; this helped explain the great amount of endemic speciation, which many biologists believe could not have occurred in a lesser amount of time. The existing Galapagos Islands were formed between 700,000 and 5,000,000 years ago, making them geologically young.

Their homeland, known as  Lenapehoking, included the present-day areas of  Staten Island,  Manhattan,  the Bronx, the western portion of  Long Island (including  Brooklyn and  Queens), and the  Lower Hudson Valley.

The first non‚ÄìNative American inhabitant of what became New York City was  Juan Rodriguez, a merchant from  Santo Domingo who arrived in Manhattan during the winter of 1613‚Äì14, trapping for  pelts and trading with the local population as a representative of the Dutch colonists.

In 1625, construction was started on a  citadel and  Fort Amsterdam, later called  [43]  [44]  Lower Manhattan. Its area extended from the southern tip of Manhattan to modern-day  Wall Street, where a 12-foot (3.7\\xa0m) wooden  stockade was built in 1653 to protect against Native American and English raids.

This program had little success.[51]  Since 1621, the Dutch West India Company had operated as a monopoly in New Netherland, on authority granted by the Dutch States General. In 1639‚Äì1640, in an effort to bolster economic growth, the Dutch West India Company relinquished its monopoly over the fur trade, leading to growth in the production and trade of food, timber, tobacco, and slaves (particularly with the Dutch West Indies).[24][52]  Peter Stuyvesant began his tenure as the last  Director-General of New Netherland.

Galapagos finches, for example, have developed a multitude of adaptive types from one common ancestral type; their subspecies now differ mainly in beak shape and size. The swimming marine  iguanas, which feed on seaweed and in some places cover the coastal rocks by the hundreds, are unique and endemic. Another species of interest is the flightless cormorant. In addition, penguins and fur seals live on the islands side by side with tropical animals. A geologic study published in 1992 suggested that underwater seamounts near the Galapagos had formed islands between 5,000,000 and 9,000,000 years ago; this helped explain the great amount of endemic speciation, which many biologists believe could not have occurred in a lesser amount of time. The existing Galapagos Islands were formed between 700,000 and 5,000,000 years ago, making them geologically young.

Galapagos finches, for example, have developed a multitude of adaptive types from one common ancestral type; their subspecies now differ mainly in beak shape and size. The swimming marine  iguanas, which feed on seaweed and in some places cover the coastal rocks by the hundreds, are unique and endemic. Another species of interest is the flightless cormorant. In addition, penguins and fur seals live on the islands side by side with tropical animals. A geologic study published in 1992 suggested that underwater seamounts near the Galapagos had formed islands between 5,000,000 and 9,000,000 years ago; this helped explain the great amount of endemic speciation, which many biologists believe could not have occurred in a lesser amount of time. The existing Galapagos Islands were formed between 700,000 and 5,000,000 years ago, making them geologically young.
